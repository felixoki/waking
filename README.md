# Waken

Waken is a multiplayer cozy game with adventurous elements. Players tend to a small village and its needs, including farming crops, taming animals, and gathering resources.

The player possesses a rare gift: Sleepwander. They can traverse dimensions within dreams and materialize treasures from them. Their mission is to defeat a cunning entity that has long plagued the villagers' sleep. But they aren't the only ones who can walk the dream world. A dangerous cult seeks to empower the evil being further. And the dreamy realms they inhabit can be just as perilous as the creature they're hunting.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs dependencies for both client and server workspaces.

### 2. Run development servers

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs both the server (port 3001) and client (port 3000) concurrently.

Alternatively, run them separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Server
npm run dev:server

# Terminal 2 - Client
npm run dev:client
```

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Server commands

```bash
npm run server:deploy    # Deploy to production
npm run server:connect   # SSH into server
npm run server:logs      # View logs
npm run server:status    # Check status
npm run server:restart   # Restart server
```

## Client target

```bash
npm run client:local     # Point to localhost
npm run client:remote    # Point to production
```

## Architecture

The client connects to a lobby server over HTTP which spawns and assigns world instances. Each world maintains its own WebSocket connection to connected clients, caches live state in Redis, and persists player data to Postgres.

  Client["Client :3000"]
  Lobby["Lobby :3100"]
  World["World :3001+"]
  PG["Postgres :5432"]
  RD["Redis :6379"]

  Client -- HTTP --> Lobby
  Lobby -- spawn --> World
  Client -- WebSocket --> World
  World -- cache --> RD
  World -- persist --> PG
  Lobby -- read/write --> PG
```

Production: `178.104.59.213`

## System design

### Entity system

All entities share a single `Entity` class. What an entity *is* is defined by its components, what it's *doing* by its current state, and what's *happening to it* by its effects, all attachable and detachable at runtime. Every entity produces the same input structure each tick (players from the keyboard, AI from a behavior queue), which is resolved into state transitions. Players broadcast their input over the network; the update loop makes no distinction between local and remote. Entity definitions are plain config objects shared between client and server; an orc and a tree use the same structure, just different fields.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Entity {
    components: Map~Component~
    effects: Map~Effect~
    states: Map~State~
    update(input)
    transitionTo(state)
    addComponent() / removeComponent()
    addEffect() / removeEffect()
  }

  class Player {
    inputManager: InputManager
    _getInput() → keyboard
  }

  class Component {
    attach()
    update()
    detach()
  }

  class State {
    enter(entity)
    update(entity)
    exit(entity)
  }

  class Behavior {
    update(entity) → Input
    reset()
  }

  class Effect {
    attach()
    update()
    detach()
  }

  class BehaviorQueue {
    add(behavior)
    update() → Input
  }

  class StateResolver {
    resolve(input, prev) → state
  }

  Player --|> Entity : extends
  Entity *-- Component : attach / detach
  Entity *-- State : enter / exit
  Entity *-- Effect : attach / detach
  Entity *-- BehaviorQueue
  BehaviorQueue o-- Behavior : queues
  StateResolver --> Entity : drives
  Player ..> StateResolver : keyboard input
  BehaviorQueue ..> StateResolver : AI input
```

### Handlers

Handlers are stateless plain objects grouping pure functions by domain (`combat`, `move`, `state`, `player`, etc.). No classes, no instantiation, just `handlers.combat.resolve()`. Both client and server export a single `handlers` object; each handler operates on data passed in and calls sibling handlers as needed. This keeps game logic flat, composable, and free of hidden state.
